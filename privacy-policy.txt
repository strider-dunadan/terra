We may collect the following information from users:
  - Email Address: If you create an account or log in via Google.
  - Device Information: To improve app performance and display relevant ads.
  - Usage Data: To analyze app usage and enhance user experience.
  - Camera Data: When you use the plant recognition feature, we access your device's camera to capture images of plants. These images are processed to     identify plants and provide information. We do not store these images on our servers after processing, unless explicitly stated for a specific         feature you opt into (e.g., saving identified plants to a personal collection).
  - Plant Recognition Data: Information generated from the plant recognition feature, such as identified plant species, and related metadata (e.g.,        date of recognition), may be processed to provide the service and improve its accuracy.
  - Location Data: With your permission, we may access your deviceâ€™s location to check whether certain plants may exist in your area. Your location        coordinates may be processed through an external AI service to provide plant-related results.
